# rock-paper-scissor
A responsive Rock Paper Scissors game, my first project, built with HTML &amp; CSS, hosted on GitHub. Users play against the computer via clickable buttons, with real-time results. CSS adds hover effects &amp; animations, with media queries for device adaptability. Showcases my front-end skills &amp; game logic.
